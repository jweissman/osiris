# OSIRIS

A game about space, colonization and time.

## The Story So Far

Commander, please -- help our colony!

We are marooned on this desolate rock, refugees from a vessel called Osiris. 

Our wrecked ship is still floating amid the void. You can see her gossamer sails even now: that spark glinting between the moons.

All hope of rescue is lost. It is all up to you.

Forge the rudiments of a starfaring civilization and lead us back to the heavens.

The road will be long. Luckily, we have a functional cloning matrix...

Will you forge an industrial society, an intellectual republic or a bio-engineered utopia?

Whatever you choose, you must unite all the strengths of your colonists and manage to construct a functioning starport.

Our prayers are with you.

## Stories to Play

- [ok] Clone Vat (produce a clone every so often, consume a lot of meals/data)
- Reshape most buildings (i.e., permit user to set width, and so number of slots, at least on most subsurface buildings)
- Pinnacle buildings (huge devices/slots)
- [some] Tech Tree (remaining buildings; unpack building menu over time) 
- Device Palette (click to place devices in buildings; 'images' for most devices?)
- Condensed Hud (hide/show menus; construct/furnish 'modes' where menus are hidden; intangible/'providential' resources [power/atmos/hope -- pop cap/building cap/base level or wealth])
- Building backgrounds (wall and floor patterns)
- Economy (apply cost constraints; model higher-order substances: strange matter [negative-mass omnium?], algorithms [highly condensed/processed/worked data? output of a 'dev console'?], bioplasm [ some advanced biotic material?? ])
