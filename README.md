# OSIRIS

A game about space, colonization and time.

## The Story So Far

Commander, please -- help our colony!

We are marooned on this desolate rock, refugees from a vessel called Osiris. 

Our wrecked ship is still floating amid the void. You can see her gossamer sails even now: that spark glinting between the moons.

All hope of rescue is lost. It is all up to you.

Forge the rudiments of a starfaring civilization and lead us back to the heavens.

The road will be long. Luckily, we have a functional cloning matrix...

Will you forge an industrial society, an intellectual republic or a bio-engineered utopia?

Whatever you choose, you must unite all the strengths of your colonists and manage to construct a functioning starport.

Our prayers are with you.

## Stories to Play

- Tech Tree (remaining buildings/machines/functions) 
- Pinnacle buildings (huge devices/slots -- mini sun/black hole; refinery -> mineral processing, refinery becomes space fn)
- Clone Vat (make consume meals/data)
- Reshape most subsurface buildings (i.e., permit user to set width, and so number of slots, at least on common area bldgs)
- Nonstandard building shapes (triangular wedge to break up linearities, huge octagon for power plant?)
- Day-night cycle (do pawns sleep?)
- Art cycle ('images' for most devices)
- Condensed Hud (hide/show menus; construct/furnish 'modes' where menus are hidden)
- Building backgrounds (wall and floor patterns)
- improve citizen automation (give back resources when we can't fulfill something? or give them up?)
- handle construction better (better hints to user at what is expected? better state mgmt...? maybe separate construction 'scene'?)
- Enemies?
